        <h2>Content Adaptation Example</h2>
        <p>Our content has been adapted to this page template because either you are using a desktop browser, a device that is masquerading itself as desktop to get a desktop experience or your machine is not detected as a desktop, tablet or mobile but you are being redirected to this website because this is the default one.</p>
    </div>

            <h3>Content Adaptation</h3>
            <p>To adapt contents dynamically, so each visitor gets the optimum user experience. Whether the device used is a smartphone, tablet, eReader, or a low end device, you only get one chance to make a first impression. Ensure your site loads quickly and is easy to navigate. DeviceAtlas provides all the information needed to support content adaptation decisions.</p>
            <p>On a page request, DeviceAtlas API is used to get the device properties. By putting conditions on some of the properties which are usually about the device type a layout template is chosen loaded wrapped around the data and sent back to the user.</p>
            <p>Usually most of the contents remain the same and only the templates and styles are tuned for different devices.</p>
            <p>Using the handful of DeviceAtlas properties each template can be fine-tuned for the device and browser</p>

            <h3>Image</h3>
            <p>Let's say we want to display a photo, as we now know the type of device viewing the page, we can select a photo which is the most suitable for the device. We can even optimize the page further and use property values such as "displayWidth", "displayHeight", "usableDisplayWidth" and "usableDisplayHeight" to provide the optimal photo.</p>
            <p>As we already know a desktop computer is viewing the page we have plenty of room so we can show our largest photo.</p>
            <img th:src="@{/images/homa-large.jpg}" src="../../images/homa-large.jpg" />

            <h3>Links and buttons</h3>
            <a href="#">Goto somewhere</a>
            <br/>
            <button>Do something</button>

            <h3>Can we display videos on this browser?</h3>
            <span th:text="${supportsHTMLVideo}?'This browser supports the video HTML tag, we can use it to show a video here.':'This browser does not support the video HTML tag.'"></span>
            <span th:text="${supportsFlash}?'Flash is supported we can display flash here.':'Flash is not supported.'"></span>

            <h3>Example directory and files</h3>
            <p>The web examples are based on a MVC model where files are placed inside <strong>/Examples/ExampleWebApp</strong>, 
                having controllers in <strong>/src/main/java/com/deviceatlas/cloud/example/web</strong>
                and views in <strong>/src/main/resources</strong>.</p>
            <p>All requests first go to the <strong>ControllerWebApp</strong> controller object. Here it is used DeviceAtlas to detect device type and decides which template should be used to wrap around the contents.</p>
            <p>View of this page is <strong>templates/adaptation/desktop.html</strong></p>
